I like a well done unit test, all green balls on my Jenkins CI chain, and an empty ToDo list on my Trello board. I am delighted people are willing to pay me to do what I do for fun at home.\r\n\r\n### I build software teams\r\nI have been a CTO/co-founder and a worker bee in a big engineering team. I have hired, trained, and fired teams.
