# I build software
Web mostly, but I have automated film factories, dabbled in big data, and cranked out a product for the iPad. I like a well done unit test, all green balls on my Jenkins CI chain, and an empty ToDo list on my Trello board. I am delighted people are willing to pay me to do what I do for fun at home.

# I build software teams
I have been a CTO/co-founder and a worker bee in a big engineering team. I have hired, trained, and fired teams. I have seen the start, end, pivot, growth, and implosion phases of startups.
